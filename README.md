- Delivery Time Prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate delivery times using a rich dataset that includes both geographic and service-related features. The analysis encompasses data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling steps to improve the model's accuracy in time predictions. Key aspects of the dataset include restaurant and customer locations, delivery distance, order details, and delivery timestamps. By examining the impact of these factors, the project seeks to understand the dynamics influencing delivery time and enhance the accuracy of time predictions for practical applications in delivery optimization.
The predictive model successfully integrates diverse features to provide accurate estimates for delivery durations, making it useful for optimizing delivery operations.
